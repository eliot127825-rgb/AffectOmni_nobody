**💭 Thinking**

> As I watch the video, I notice the man on the left in a plaid shirt and striped tie. His expression is calm, and he seems focused on the conversation. However, when the man on the right, who is holding a pie, suddenly moves towards him, his expression shifts. I see him go from calm to surprised, and he looks a bit confused. This sudden action definitely caught him off guard.
>
> Now, listening to the audio, the man on the left is speaking in a hurried and excited tone, which suggests he's really into the topic. The man on the right, in the dark shirt and yellow striped tie, responds calmly and gently, even slowing his speech down, which seems to ease any tension. They're talking about a debate between cake and pie, and the man on the right eventually wins and uses the pie to make a point.
>
> So, considering his calm demeanor before the sudden action and his surprised, confused look afterward, I conclude he was definitely taken aback by the sudden movement with the pie, but he didn't show fear. He was surprised, but not scared.

**✅ Answer: A**
